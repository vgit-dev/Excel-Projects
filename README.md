# Excel-Projects
In this mini project we are using an Employee Table to extract infomation 
based on specific criteria.

We have 6 filtering scenarios and by using the appropriate parametres inside the FILTER function
we are trying to extract the relevant information.

In other words we are building queries using the powerfull Excel FILTER function.
